# Memory Lane (frontend)

This patch adds:
- `/assets/featured/` with 5 optimized images (example 'Featured finds' grid)
- Updated `index.html` to display featured images + clearer client-ready copy
- `/about/` page scaffold

## What you still need to add
Put these in `/assets/` (case-sensitive) so the "Quick proof" section doesn't 404:
- `bizcard.jpg`
- `domain.jpg`

## Deploy notes
- GitHub Pages: works fine for static pages + images
- Netlify Forms: only submits when deployed on Netlify. If staying on GitHub Pages, swap the form action to Formspree.
