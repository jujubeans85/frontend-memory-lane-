# Memory Lane Patch — Split Pages v3

Pages:
- / (Home)
- /services/
- /featured/
- /gallery/ (with category filters)
- /enquire/
- /about/

Images:
- Uses one reliable placeholder image: /assets/placeholder.png (your logo) so nothing breaks.
- Also includes /assets/bizcard.jpg and /assets/domain.jpg as placeholders to avoid 404s.

Paths:
This repo is deployed on GitHub Pages at /frontend-memory-lane-/ so links and assets use that prefix.
If you later use a custom domain root, remove '/frontend-memory-lane-' from href/src paths.
